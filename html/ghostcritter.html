	<h1 class="center">You have been revived as a ghost critter!</h1><img src="{{resource("images/ghostcritter.png")}}" class="center" />

	<p>You've miraculously found another chance at life. What do you do?</p>

	<p>Well, first, you should treat this as a new life. This means you shouldn't hold grudges from your previous one.<p>

	<p>Second, you shouldn't be attacking any humans unless in self defense, because that's pretty mean! Rivalries or feuds with other ghost critters are fine, of course.</p>

	<p>Third, and hopefully the most obvious, you <b>are not an antag</b> and should not act like one. That means you shouldn't do anything too disruptive or something that would be considered as grief.</p>
