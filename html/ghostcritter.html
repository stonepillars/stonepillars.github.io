What do you do?</p> <p>Well, first, you should treat this as a new life. This means you shouldn't hold grudges from your previous one.</p><p> </p><p>Second, you shouldn't be attacking any humans unless in self defense, because that's pretty mean! Rivalries or feuds with other ghost critters are fine, of course.</p> <p>Third, and hopefully the most obvious, you <b>are not an antag</b> and should not act like one. That means you shouldn't do anything too disruptive or something that would be considered as grief.</p> </body> </html>
